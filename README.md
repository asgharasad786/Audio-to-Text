# Speech-to-Text Transcription App

This project is a **Speech-to-Text** transcription application built with **Streamlit** and the **Hugging Face Transformers** library. It allows users to upload an MP3 audio file, processes it using a pre-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) model, and displays the transcribed text on the screen.

## Features

- Upload an MP3 audio file.
- Process the audio file and transcribe it to text using the `AudioSangraha-Audio_to_Text` model from Hugging Face.
- Display the transcribed text in a text area for easy manual copying.

## Model Details

This app uses the `AqeelShafy7/AudioSangraha-Audio_to_Text` model available on Hugging Face. The model is a **pre-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) model** that can transcribe audio to text. It was trained on a variety of audio datasets and supports a wide range of speech recognition tasks.

## Requirements

To run this app locally, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- Hugging Face Transformers

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <path-to-repository>
   cd speech-to-text-transcription
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Install all the necessary Python libraries using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This will install the following dependencies:
   - `streamlit`
   - `transformers`

3. **Start the Streamlit app**:
   Run the following command to launch the app:

   ```bash
